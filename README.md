diffHTML is a library that assists with creating user interfaces using
JavaScript. These interfaces can be: applications, games, data visualizations,
or anything else that you may want to render in a web browser.

This repository is a mono-repo structured with the [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)
CLI tool. This makes it easier to support continuous integration, consistent
versioning, and working on the various diffHTML tools.

be tested globally or independently by using `npm test` at the root directory
level or any specific nested package level.

  smaller runtime build (which excludes HTML parser, tagged templates, and
  performance metrics).

* **[diffhtml-components](/packages/diffhtml-components)**

  Provides a React Like and identical Web Component API. If you're looking for
  the full React API, refer to the

  Logs out information at the start and end of every render transaction.

* **[diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events)**

  middleware uses `addEventListener` hooks to the `body` element and captures
  events using delegation.

* **[diffhtml-middleware-inline-transitions](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-inline-transitions)**

  By default diffHTML provides transition hooks at a global level. This
  middleware turns them into scoped, performant, event hooks.

  Asserts that a render properly updated the old Virtual Tree and the DOM.
