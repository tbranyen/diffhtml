Latest version: 1.0.0-beta.29

diffHTML is an extremely lightweight and optimized HTML parser and Virtual DOM
specifically designed for modern web UIs. These interfaces can be applications,
games, data visualizations, or anything that you may want to render in a web
browser or Node.

The core package works like a library, where you can import just one function
and have a fully reactive VDOM rendering engine. When you opt into more
functions and use the companion packages you get a framework for structuring
your ideas.

## Features

- Parses real **HTML** and supports **JSX & Tagged Templates**.
- Memory efficient VDOM rendering that utilizes **object pooling**.
- Powerful **middleware** extends diffHTML with additional features.
- **React-like** Components which can be rendered as **Web Components**.
- A **lite** build which has a smaller size, meant for optimizing production code.

Works great with legacy and modern browsers, Node.js, Deno, and with whatever
your favorite JavaScript runtime is.

## Packages

The following list of modules are nested in the `/packages` folder. They form
the foundation of the diffHTML ecosystem.

* [diffhtml](/packages/diffhtml)

  ```sh
  npm install diffhtml
  ```

  The core public API for creating user interfaces. Contains a standard build
  which includes everything, and a smaller optimized build that excludes the
  HTML parser and performance metrics, which is useful for those who want to
  minimize the filesize.

* [diffhtml-components](/packages/diffhtml-components)

  ```sh
  npm install diffhtml-components
  ```

  Provides constructors and middleware for rendering stateful/stateless
  components seamlessly. The API will be very familiar to anyone
  who has used React as the class methods and structure are the same.

* [babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml](/packages/babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml)

  ```sh
  npm install diffhtml-rust-parser
  ```

  **Coming soon**

  An alternative parser written in Rust, providing a wrapper around the
  [tl](https://docs.rs/tl/latest/tl/) library.

* [babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml](/packages/babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml)

  ```sh
  npm install babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml
  ```

  Transforms your input into function calls. This eliminates the need for
  runtime parsing. This is similar to how React compiles down JSX.

* [diffhtml-middleware-linter](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-linter)

  ```sh
  npm install diffhtml-middleware-linter
  ```

  This module will run various linting rules on your input to ensure you are
  writing valid/well-formed HTML. This was inspired by and uses rules from the
  [HTMLHint](https://htmlhint.com/) project.

* [diffhtml-middleware-logger](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-logger)

  ```sh
  npm install diffhtml-middleware-logger
  ```

  Logs out diffHTML state from the start and end of every render transaction.

* [diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events)

  ```sh
  npm install diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events
  ```

  Changes the event binding from inline event handlers like `onclick = fn` to
  use `addEventListener`. Events are attached to the `body` element and
  coordinated to children through delegation.

* [diffhtml-middleware-service-worker](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-service-worker)

  ```sh
  npm install diffhtml-middleware-service-worker
  ```

  Helps with the creation of a service worker for PWAs, available as a
  convenience to make development more friendlier.

* [diffhtml-website](/packages/diffhtml-website)

  The source for the [www.diffhtml.org](https://www.diffhtml.org) website.
