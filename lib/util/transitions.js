 * attached
 * --------
 *
 * For when elements come into the DOM. The callback triggers immediately after
 * the element enters the DOM. It is called with the element as the only
 * argument.
 *
 * detached
 * --------
 *
 * For when elements are removed from the DOM. The callback triggers just
 * before the element leaves the DOM. It is called with the element as the only
 * argument.
 *
 * replaced
 * --------
 *
 * For when elements are replaced in the DOM. The callback triggers after the
 * new element enters the DOM, and before the old element leaves. It is called
 * with old and new elements as arguments, in that order.
 *
 * attributeChanged
 * ----------------
 *
 * Triggered when an element's attribute has changed. The callback triggers
 * after the attribute has changed in the DOM. It is called with the element,
 * the attribute name, old value, and current value.
 *
 * textChanged
 * -----------
 *
 * Triggered when an element's `textContent` chnages. The callback triggers
 * after the textContent has changed in the DOM. It is called with the element,
 * the old value, and current value.
