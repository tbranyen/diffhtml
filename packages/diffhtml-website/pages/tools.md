## <a href="#babel-transform">Babel Transform (Optimize builds)</a>

The Babel plugin is useful after you have a working project and wish to
optimize it at build time. The Babel plugin will perform numerous optimizations
to your code depending on how it is written and structured. For instance,
anytime you have an element that does not change, the call will be hoisted and
reused instead of recreated every time. Any `html` tagged template calls will
be converted to `createTree` calls.

**After your code has been passed through this plugin, you will be able to fully
utilize the lite build!**

To use, install into your project as a dev dependency.

``` sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml
```

Specify the plugin in the Babel configuration, usually a `.babelrc` or
`babel.config.js` file:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml"]
}
```

Take this code as an example input:

```javascript
const { innerHTML, html } = require('diffhtml');

function render() {
  innerHTML(document.body, html`
    <div>Hello world</div>
  `);
}
```

Without this Babel transformation process, this HTML would need to be parsed
every time `render()` is called. If you use the lite build and the parser,
this will become a cached call. `html` is the same thing as `createTree` in the
lite build. So there is no HTML parsing happening.

```javascript
const { innerHTML, html } = require('diffhtml/dist/cjs/lite');

function render() {
  innerHTML(document.body, html('div', {}, [html('#text', null, 'Hello world')]));
}
```
